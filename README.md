# 🔬 Acromo - Teambuilding Helper

Acromo is a modern Pokemon team analysis tool built with **Blazor WebAssembly**. It helps competitive players analyze their teams by providing comprehensive insights into type coverage, team archetypes, and competitive viability based on SV OU (Scarlet/Violet Overused) standards.

The application features a nostalgic **Pokemon Generation 5 (Black & White)** inspired UI theme.

## ✨ Features

- **🖼️ Visual Display**: Automatically fetches Pokemon and item sprites (including Gen 8+ items like Heavy-Duty Boots).
- **📊 Type Coverage Analysis**:
  - Identifies neutral coverage gaps.
  - Highlights super-effective coverage against the team.
  - Lists immunity notes based on abilities and items.
- **🧠 Archetype Detection**: Automatically classifies your team as Stall, Semi-Stall, Hyper Offense, or Balanced.
- **✅ Competitive Rating**: Evaluates your team against 15+ competitive criteria (hazards, speed control, utility, etc.) and assigns a grade.
- **🎨 Gen 5 UI**: A fully custom CSS theme inspired by the Pokemon Black & White interface.
